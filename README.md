- ⚡ Fun fact: ...you ready? in the early days of mobile phones sending txt messages compared to now had 1 major function that the most cutting edge smartphones with whatsapp type apps have not! everything sms txt messaging on a old Nokia but better more plus to much shit thats impossible with old phone txt mssging BUT even when multi press the number buttons to type the letter u need , it was up to a certain point possible to send *are you ready for it?* NOTHING! And i mean that seriously. if you didnt type anything what so ever and press send the recieving number got a empty blank space message. these days in whatsapp and sms txt messaging alike thats not amongst the options/functionality
- but it had even more epic implications. if you at least kept the amount of digits/characters within the max allowed in 1 message and having the option to use every one of those to fill with space button emptyness.. yes you would be on the recieving end wondering exactly how much nothing was actually send to you hahaha. u know for sure it must have been within the boundaries of nothing nothing or the amount of characters max allowed before the message continues in a 2nd message. And so when using up all the space within limitations by skipping with the space button suggested no matter what the mystery of *ok i got just a message with nothing,But curious how much was send to me.*
